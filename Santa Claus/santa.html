                        <li>St. Nicholas is the world's most popular non-Biblical saint. He has over 2,000 churches dedicated to him in France and Germany, and 400 in England</li>
                        <li>Artists have portrayed St. Nicholas more times than any other saint except Mary</li>
                        <li>St. Nicholas is also the patron saint of banking, pawnbroking, scholarship, pirating, butchery, sailing, thievery, haberdashery, orphans, royalty, and New York City</li>
                        <li>German-born American illustrator Thomas Nast (1840-1902) helped create the modern version of Santa as jolly, chubby, and dressed mainly in red. Coca-Cola further solidified his image in the mainstream media in 1931 when they used him in their advertising</li>
                        <li>St. Nicholas (who would later become Santa Claus) became famous when he gave three poor girls their dowries so they wouldn't be sold into prostitution</li>
                        <li>The figure of Santa Claus is based on St. Nicholas, a real person who lived during the fourth century in Patara, or what is now Turkey</li>
                        <li>The remains of St. Nicholas, an early precursor to Santa Claus, are in Italy. Looters stole half of his skeleton as well as other relics</li>
                        <li>Believing in Santa Claus cultivates a child's imagination and ability to think of possibilities and potentialities</li>
                        <li>All letters addressed to Santa in the United States go to Santa Claus, Indiana</li>
